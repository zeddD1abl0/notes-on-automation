A collection of information related to PXE booting, SaltStack, Terraform, and the idiosyncracies within.

## Elastic
Technically not [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), as I don't actually have a use for the search engine piece. But the [Logging/Metrics/APM](https://www.elastic.co/integrations/) services and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/)? I AM IM.

## PXE

The PXE folder contains a number of details around PXE booting both Windows and Linux from the Linux world. Mainly with iPXE, because it's awesome, but there's some basic PXE stuff in there in case you need a history lesson.

## SaltStack

The [SaltStack](https://docs.saltproject.io/) folder covers a huge amount of extra information regarding [SaltStack](https://docs.saltproject.io/), including some very simple pointers about folder layout, configurations and traps I've fallen into over time

## Terraform
The Terraform folder contains some basics about the use of Terraform, including some extended documentation that I found unclear in the [Terraform.io guide](https://www.terraform.io/intro).
